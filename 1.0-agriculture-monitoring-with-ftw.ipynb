    "# 🌎 Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pathways to Positive Impact  \n",
    "Agriculture both drives and is affected by climate change. Agricultural expansion and poor land management contribute significantly to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, climate change itself threatens crop yields, food security, and rural livelihoods. Accurate, up-to-date data about where fields are located and how they are being managed is essential for building sustainable and resilient food systems. However, this information is often unavailable, outdated, or fragmented in many parts of the world.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the **Fields of The World (FTW)** machine learning ecosystem and demonstrates how it can be used to automatically generate field boundaries globally. These boundaries provide a foundation for downstream monitoring tasks like crop type classification and forest loss detection, which are critical for climate-related decision-making.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who will use these models and how?  \n",
    "* 🌍 **Policymakers and regulators** (e.g., under the EU Deforestation Regulation, EUDR) can use field-level monitoring to verify compliance with deforestation-free supply chains. This ensures that commodities like soy, palm oil, and cocoa are not driving illegal forest loss.  \n",
    "* 🌱 **NGOs, development organizations, and agencies** can use the models to track agricultural expansion and design interventions that protect vulnerable ecosystems while supporting farmers.  \n",
    "* 🏭 **Private sector actors** (e.g., food companies, climate-tech startups, or Monitoring Reporting and Verification (MRV) service providers) can integrate field boundary datasets and models into supply chain monitoring systems, helping corporations meet sustainability pledges and reduce climate risk.  \n",
    "* 👩‍🌾 **Farmers and cooperatives** can benefit indirectly through improved access to climate finance, climate-smart certifications, carbon markets, or targeted advisory services built on these monitoring tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-world impact and decision pathways  \n",
    "1. 🌾 **Crop type classification** models support yield forecasting, production estimation, and food security planning. Governments and international agencies can anticipate shortages and mobilize relief efforts earlier, reducing vulnerability to climate-driven shocks. In-season crop type maps enable rapid response assessments of damage to food production when disasters such as floods, fires, or tornadoes occur.  \n",
    "2. 🌳 **Forest loss monitoring** within agricultural landscapes helps identify where land-use change is contributing to emissions and biodiversity loss. This informs land-use policy, conservation programs, and corporate sustainability audits and helps farmers/producers provide evidence for sustainable supply chain certifications.  \n",
    "3. ⏱️ Combining these tools allows for **near-real-time, transparent monitoring** of agriculture and forest interactions at the field scale.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### System-level outcomes  \n",
    "By equipping users with the ability to generate field boundaries and link them to climate-relevant monitoring tasks, this tutorial lowers the barrier for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to access and deploy advanced geospatial AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact pathway extends from **technical outputs** (field boundaries, crop maps, forest loss detections) → to **actionable insights** (crop yield forecasts, deforestation alerts) → to **systemic changes** in agricultural management, supply chain governance, and climate adaptation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods have the potential to reduce emissions, protect ecosystems, and build resilience for farming communities worldwide.  "

    "\n",
    "To successfully follow the tutorial, users should be comfortable with the following concepts:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* 🗺️ **Field boundaries**: Polygons that delineate agricultural fields on the Earth’s surface. They provide a spatial unit for monitoring and analysis, enabling crop type classification, yield prediction, and land-use change assessment.  \n",
    "* 🛰️ **Remote sensing / Earth observations**: Data captured by satellites (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat) that provide multi-spectral views of Earth. Remote sensing allows large-scale, repeatable, and timely monitoring of agriculture and forests.  \n",
    "* 📐 **Vector vs. raster data**: Vector data (points, lines, polygons) represent discrete features such as field boundaries, while raster data represent gridded continuous surfaces such as satellite images or deforestation maps.  \n",
    "* 🌾 **Crop type classification**: A machine learning task that assigns labels (e.g., maize, soy, wheat) to agricultural fields based on spectral and temporal information from satellite imagery. This supports food security planning and yield forecasting.  \n",
    "* 🌳 **Forest loss monitoring**: The detection of deforestation events, often using global datasets (e.g., Hansen Global Forest Change). Linking these to field boundaries helps assess whether agricultural expansion is driving forest loss.  "

    "\n",
    "Crop type mapping involves classifying agricultural fields into categories such as maize, wheat, soy, or rice, usually using satellite imagery and machine learning. A key challenge is that ground truth labels (farmer surveys, government records, or field visits) are scarce, expensive to collect, and unevenly distributed across the globe. This is especially true in regions where data infrastructure is weak but where climate change impacts on agriculture are most severe (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, parts of South Asia, Amazonia).\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-label or weakly supervised methods allow us to train crop classification models using very limited labeled data, combined with large volumes of unlabeled satellite imagery. Techniques like transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, or foundation models can help enable accurate mapping even in data-sparse regions.\n",

    "The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is an annual, raster-based land cover dataset produced by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). It is generated using satellite imagery (primarily Landsat, Sentinel-2, and other sensors) combined with ground-truth data from NASS surveys and the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Each pixel in the CDL is classified into a specific crop type or land cover class at 30 m (and more recently 10 m) spatial resolution, using supervised machine learning algorithms such as decision trees.\n",

    "For the purposes of this tutorial we use the CDL data as a source of labels for our crop type mapping task by assuming that the majority class within each field polygon is the crop type for that field. While this is a simplification, the key aspect is that we can perform spatial joins between field boundaries and other spatial datasets to serve as the basis of downstream analysis.\n",

    "# 🎓 Final Discussion & Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises in this tutorial notebook demonstrated the following lessons related to the tutorial’s learning outcomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🌐 **Field boundaries as a foundation for agricultural monitoring**: Generating and using field boundaries provides a common framework for linking remote sensing data to agricultural monitoring tasks.  \n",
    "2. 🌳 **Forest loss monitoring**: We saw how forest change datasets can be intersected with field polygons to identify which agricultural fields are associated with recent deforestation. This connects directly to real-world needs such as supply chain verification and compliance with regulations like the EU Deforestation Regulation.  \n",
    "3. 🌾 **Crop type mapping with few labels**: This example highlighted how even limited ground-truth labels can be leveraged for crop classification, and how model accuracy scales with more training data. This is particularly relevant for regions where data scarcity is a barrier to climate monitoring.  \n",
    "4. 🔄 **End-to-end workflow practice**: By completing both exercises, users experienced the process of generating field boundaries, integrating them with open datasets, applying machine learning, and critically interpreting the results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟪 Field boundary polygons\n",
    "- 🟪 FTW polygons are generated automatically using machine learning models, not hand-drawn cadastral maps.  \n",
    "- 🟪 Boundaries may not always perfectly align with actual field edges, especially in regions with irregularly shaped plots or complex land-use mosaics.  \n",
    "- 🟪 Polygons are derived from medium-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2 at 10 m). Smallholder plots below the resolution threshold may not be delineated or may be merged into larger polygons.  \n",
    "  - ⚠️ This introduces a bias toward large, industrial fields, while potentially underrepresenting smallholder farms that dominate in many Global South contexts.  \n",
    "- 🟪 Model performance can vary across regions due to differences in landscape patterns, cloud cover, and availability of training data. While the FTW training dataset includes 24 countries across 4 continents (Africa, South America, Asia, and Europe), most of the training data comes from Europe.  \n",
    "  - ⚠️ Boundaries may be more accurate in data-rich areas (e.g., Europe) and less reliable in underrepresented regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa and South America).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌳 Forest loss example\n",
    "- 🌳 The Hansen Global Forest Change dataset measures **tree cover loss** at 30 m resolution but does not differentiate between permanent deforestation and temporary disturbances (e.g., fire, logging cycles).  \n",
    "- 🌳 Field boundaries may be smaller than the Hansen pixels, creating uncertainty in attributing loss to specific fields.  \n",
    "- 🌳 The dataset baseline begins in 2000, so older deforestation is not captured.  \n",
    "- 🌳 Results should therefore be interpreted as relative patterns of recent loss, not complete histories of land-use change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌾 Crop type mapping example\n",
    "- 🌾 The exercise with the USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL) showed how to perform classification with few labels, but CDL itself is only available for the U.S. and may not generalize globally. \n",
    "- 🌾 Model performance improves with more training labels, but in many regions outside the U.S. labeled crop data is sparse or unavailable.  \n",
    "- 🌾 Crop type classification accuracy is also affected by cloud cover, sensor resolution, and crop heterogeneity within fields.  \n"

    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, readers should be able to:  \n",
    "* 🌍 Apply the **Fields of the World (FTW)** dataset to generate field boundaries for any location.  \n",
    "* 🌾 Use those boundaries for downstream applications such as **crop type classification** and **forest loss monitoring**.  \n",
    "* 🧭 Critically assess the **strengths and limitations** of satellite-based monitoring for agriculture-related decision making.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps for readers could include:  \n",
    "1. 🕒 **Temporal evolution of field boundaries**: Tracking how agricultural field boundaries evolve — whether through expansion into forests, fragmentation of small plots, or consolidation into large industrial fields — provides insight into the dynamics of land-use change under climate and economic pressures.  \n",
    "2. 📈 **Scaling up analyses**: Moving from local examples to larger regional or national scales. \n",
    "3. 🌱 **Exploring additional crops or land-use types**: Extending classification tasks to multiple crop classes or to mixed land-use systems.  \n",
    "4. 🏛️ **Integrating socio-economic data**: Combining geospatial monitoring with trade, policy, or farmer-level data to evaluate climate adaptation strategies.  \n",
    "5. 🤝 **Validating with local knowledge**: Collaborating with farmers, NGOs, or government agencies to ground-truth and improve the results.  \n",
    "6. 💻 **Contributing to FTW**: FTW is an open-source project. Read more about [how you can contribute](https://fieldsofthe.world/contributing.html) to the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌡️ Other Potential Applications  \n",
    "\n",
    "The methods introduced in this tutorial can be extended to a wide range of additional use cases, including:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* 🌾 **Yield forecasting**: Using crop type maps and time-series vegetation indices to estimate production under climate variability.  \n",
    "* 💧 **Drought monitoring**: Assessing the impacts of water stress on specific crops or regions using field boundaries as spatial units.  \n",
    "* 🌍 **Greenhouse gas accounting**: Linking crop maps to emission factors for different farming systems to improve agricultural GHG inventories.  \n",
    "* 🔗 **Sustainable supply chain monitoring**: Verifying compliance with deforestation-free regulations (e.g., EUDR) or corporate sustainability pledges.  \n",
    "* 📊 **Climate adaptation planning**: Identifying shifts in crop distributions due to temperature and rainfall changes to inform adaptation strategies.  \n"
